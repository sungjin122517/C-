## Mastermind  
is a program where 4 random numbers are produced and a code breaker guesses both the number and its position (kind of 숫자야구).  
- For each poisition guessed, if the color is the same as the code, the codemaker shows a red pin as a response  
- If the color at the position is wrong, but the color appears at another position in the code, then the codemaker shows a white pin.
